# SQL & Analytics Portfolio  
**From Reproducible Data Models to Engineering Design Tools**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a curated portfolio of analytics and modeling study cases built on industrial metallurgy data.

The focus is not on isolated machine-learning experiments, but on **end-to-end analytical thinking**:  
from reproducible data modeling to interpretable models and engineering-ready decision tools.

Each study case builds on the previous one, forming a **coherent analytical roadmap** rather than a set of standalone projects.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Designing **reproducible SQL-based analytics models**
- Bridging **data engineering, analytics, and modeling**
- Evaluating predictive signal **before increasing model complexity**
- Translating models into **practical engineering decision tools**
- Emphasizing **interpretability, uncertainty, and decision value** over metric chasing

## Portfolio Roadmap

| Study Case | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **1** | From spreadsheets to a reproducible SQL analytics model |
| **2** | Chemistry-only baseline predictive modeling |
| **3** | Generalization across alloys and tempers |
| **4** | Screening which additional variables are worth measuring |
| **5** | Quantifying the benefit of added variables |
| **6** | Engineering-oriented design maps and decision tools |

## Technologies & Stack

- **PostgreSQL** — data modeling and semantic layer  
- **SQL** — staging, cleaning, analytics-ready views  
- **Python** — analysis, modeling, uncertainty  
- **Git** — versioned, reproducible workflows  

---

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each study case lives in its own directory.

Every case includes:
- A clear problem statement
- A methodology overview
- Results and key insights

The cases are intended to be read **in order**, but each can stand alone.

## Guiding Principles

This portfolio follows a few core principles:

**Data before models**  
Trustworthy analysis starts with a well-defined data grain and clear semantics.

**Signal before complexity**  
Simple models are explored first to understand limits and opportunities.

**Engineering value over peak performance**  
Calibration, uncertainty, and stability matter more than marginal R² gains.

**Decision-oriented outputs**  
Every study case produces artifacts that could realistically support engineering decisions.

## Audience

This portfolio is intended for:
- Data scientists working with **industrial or physical systems**
- Process, product, or materials engineers interested in analytics
- Engineers focused on **analytics-driven decision making**
- Teams seeking **interpretable, decision-oriented models**
- Hiring managers evaluating **end-to-end analytical maturity**

---

## Note

> This portfolio prioritizes engineering usefulness and interpretability over chasing maximum model performance.  
> It is intentionally **not** about state-of-the-art benchmark competition.

It demonstrates how to:
- Build trust in data
- Establish predictive limits
- Justify complexity incrementally
- Deliver tools that engineers can actually use

## Status

> This repository is under active development.  
> Study cases will be added progressively following the roadmap above.
